0.1 Rev 117:

    Fixed several bugs raised by James Antill:
    1. HEAD didn't get an Accept: header added like GET.
    2. HEAD requests did not use the cache.
    3. GET requests with Range: headers would erroneously return a full cached response.
    And one feature request for 'method' to default to GET.

0.1 Rev 86 
    
    Initial Release
